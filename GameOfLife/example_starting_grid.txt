Any line that contains a '!' symbol is a comment and is ignored. The '!' symbol overrules the '$' symbol.
The grid height and width are automatically determined by the rectangle that connects the '$' symbols! (upper left corner and right lower corner)
You can use a mix of tabs and spaces !

This starting grid is Gosper's Glider Gun. The "gun" at the top will repeatedly fire off gliders that head southwest!
